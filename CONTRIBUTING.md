# Welcome! We're always looking for new contributors!
If this is your first time contributing, take a minute to read through this document to make good issues / Pull Requests. That way they'll be accepted sooner!

## Making good issues:
If you find a bug in the application, or you have an idea about a new feature that should be added, browse through the already created issues to see if someone else already created one.
Does the issue not exist yet? Create a new one then!
When creating a new issue, make sure to use the issue templates.

## Working on an issue:
Are you looking to contribute by working on a new feature or bug? Browse through the [open issues](https://github.com/JefvdA/gh-auto/issues) to see what needs to be done.

When you found something you want to work on, comment on the issue to ask if you can work on it, we'll assign you to the issue so we know what everyone is working on.


When you are assinged to your issue, and can start to work, fork the repository and create a new branch to work on.

### Branch naming
Naming conventions to use when creating a new branch:
`name_type_issuenumber_description`

Say I, JefvdA, would create an issue (#45) to add a new command that creates a repository, a good branch name would be:
`JefvdA_feat_45_create_repository_command`

Types could also be 'bug', 'docs', 'test', ...

### Commit naming
When creating new commits, use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as a naming convention.

### Creating a pull request
If you think you are done with your work, push the new branch to your forked repository. Then create a pull request, and wait for someone to review your code!
